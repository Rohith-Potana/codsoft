Greetings to everyone, I am Potana Sai Rohtith, USN 1DS21CS141, from DSCE, of batch 2021-2025. I am doing this Codsoft online internship, as part of my Internship credit subject as per VTU mandate. For my internship, I worked on the domain of "DATA SCIENCE", where I worked on prediction models using jupyterNotebook and python to obtain results from kaggle datasets.
